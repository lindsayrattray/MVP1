            <p>Tell your students to turn <strong>on</strong> their phones. Or their iPads. Or take them to the computer room. Whatever device you decide to use, make sure they're connected to the internet and tell them where to go.</p>
            <p>Your activity can be full of pre-loaded language, from you, or one of our libraries. Or, if you really want a dynamic class, students provide the input too!</p>
